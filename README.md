# phishing-url-detection
8th sem project
Phishing is the most commonly used social engineering and cyber attack. 
Through such attacks, the phisher targets na√Øve online users by tricking them 
into revealing confidential information, with the purpose of using it 
fraudulently. In order to avoid getting phished, users should have awareness of 
phishing websites.This System is machine learning based model.We use Kaggle
as our dataset.We extract 16 different feature from those url and train our 
model.We use decision tree, svm and ann to train the model and we got 
maximum accuracy from ann. So, we decide to use ann as our machine learning 
algorithm,and make api of this model to use in our website. We make one 
website, with the help of that website user can check the url and get one alert 
box if url is phishing. On that web site, we also provoide different information 
about current cyber attacks, use of different tool and also different government 
website on which people report their complain about the cyber attack which 
they faced. We also make chrome extension.When user visit website at that time 
user can check website using that extension.
